# ENEMIES

### Skeleton
Common foot soldier for the wizards. Skeletons are somewhat intelligent and will try to dodge your attacks, but they're only really dangerous in great numbers or with Wizards to back them up. One knock with the cursed hammer keeps them down.

### Wizard
Wizards won't attack the player directly, and they're quick to turn into a bird when they get a hammer thrown at them. They can resurrect Skeletons and Burningmen to have them rejoin the fight, and their normal state is to seek out dead bones to bring back.

### Burningman
The fiercer cousin to the standard skeleton, the Burningman can fly and throw fireballs at the player. A hammer blow will douse their torch and another will kill them, so when they're not burning they run away instead of giving chase.

### Shoggoth
Eldritch subterranean monstrosities of unknown origins, the Shoggoths aren't on the wizards' side, but they're not on yours either, and their ocular beam will take out the player and other enemies alike. The beam deals two damage points, and colliding with the Shoggoth deals one. The Shoggoth is normally defensive against the hammer, but can be struck while blasting and rendered vulnerable, then taken out with another blow while they flee.
